## Four Testing Anomaly Detectors

Each anomaly detector is a clone from its respective repository. Look at the requirements file for each of the required libraries. 
- The training and testing data should be added in the dataset folder
- Each detector has been given the necessary ground truth frame level annotations in their data folder.
- After training the trained model files are in the log_dir folder.
